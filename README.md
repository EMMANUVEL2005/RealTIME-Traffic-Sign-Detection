# Real-Time Traffic Sign Detection using OpenCV

## Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time traffic sign detection system using OpenCV. It captures live video from a webcam (or video file), processes each frame to detect traffic signs, and annotates the detections in real time. The project can be extended to work with classical methods (e.g., Haar Cascade) or deep learning approaches (via OpenCV's DNN module).

## Features
- **Real-Time Processing:** Capture and process video frames instantly.
- **Traffic Sign Detection:** Identify various traffic signs such as stop signs, speed limits, and more.
- **Flexible Approaches:** Use either traditional computer vision techniques or deep learning models.
- **Visual Feedback:** Overlay bounding boxes and labels on detected signs in the live video stream.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (version 4.0 or higher)
- NumPy
